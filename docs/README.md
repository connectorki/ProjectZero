# Project Zero

A Rust-based CLI tool that bootstraps clean, reproducible software projects
with an opinionated structure, documentation, and optional automation.

---

## Why this exists

Starting a new project is repetitive and error-prone:

- inconsistent folder structures
- missing or forgotten documentation
- manual setup steps repeated every time
- friction before real development even starts

Project Zero removes this friction by generating a ready-to-use project
foundation in seconds — so you can focus on building, not scaffolding.

## What Project Zero does

With a single command, Project Zero can:

- create a new project directory
- generate a clean, opinionated folder structure
- initialize a Git repository (optional)
- create customizable `.md` documentation files
- prepare the project for immediate development

The tool is intentionally minimal and predictable.

## Quick example

```bash
project-zero init my-app --git --docs
```
